1. Importing seaborn as sns is missing (This is why Tim had trouble running it).
2. My only suggestion would be to use .head() on the dataframes that are printed out, unless there is a particular reason to print out so much.

The notebook runs through nicely. I added a warnings.filter for the matplotlib font cache load user warning. We may update the container, but for now that is a simple work-around.

Therefore, please use the attached version moving forward. I also fixed 3 small typos.

1. The multicollinearity explanation is awesome. I vote for keeping it in there, as it is a very common mistake when creating dummy variables for linear regression. @Tim - what do you think?

2. I believe the only thing left is making the two images a little smaller, as suggested by Tim in the first email.
